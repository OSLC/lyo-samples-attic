# lyo-samples-attic

Unmaintained sample code was moved here to prevent code scanners from spamming us with updates to the old code that we cannot test. The code is grouped by the latest version of Lyo they used to build and run under. Short key of guesses what prevented us from upgrading the codebase to the latest version of Lyo:

1. Lyo 2.2 - stuck on HP Labs Jena aka Apache Jena 2.x
1. Lyo 2.4 - stuck on Apache Wink / JAX-RS 1.1
1. Lyo 4.1 - stuck on the legacy OSLC4J Client.
